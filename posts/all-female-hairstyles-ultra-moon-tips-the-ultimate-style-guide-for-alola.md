Welcome, aspiring Pokémon Trainers and fashion enthusiasts, to the vibrant world of Alola! Beyond the thrill of catching powerful Pokémon and challenging formidable foes, *Pokémon Ultra Sun* and *Ultra Moon* offer an exciting dimension of personal expression: character customization. For female protagonists, the ability to transform your appearance through an array of stylish hairstyles is a delightful feature that allows you to truly make your mark on the region. This comprehensive guide will delve into all the female hairstyles available in *Ultra Moon*, offering tips, descriptions, and inspiration to help you curate the perfect look for your Alolan adventure.

**The Alolan Hair Salons: Your Style Sanctuary**

Before diving into the specifics of each style, it’s essential to know where to go for your hair transformations. The primary hair salons in Alola are located in **Hau’oli City** (Melemele Island) and **Malie City** (Ula’ula Island). Both offer the same selection of cuts and colors, with prices varying based on the complexity of the style and whether you’re also changing your hair color. A simple cut costs 2,000 Pokedollars, while a cut with color costs 4,000 Pokedollars. These salons are your gateway to expressing your unique personality through your character’s appearance.

**Unlocking Your Inner Stylist: A Deep Dive into Each Hairstyle**

*Pokémon Ultra Moon* offers a diverse range of 15 distinct hairstyles for female characters, catering to every preference, from chic bobs to flowing long locks. Let’s explore each one, complete with tips on how to rock them.

**Short & Sassy: Embracing the Pixie and Bob**

Short hairstyles are perfect for trainers who want a low-maintenance yet stylish look. They exude confidence and can highlight your character’s facial features.

1. **Short & Neat:**

   * **Description:** This classic cut features neatly trimmed hair that frames the face, often with subtle layers for a polished finish. It’s clean, professional, and timeless.
   * **Tips:** Ideal for trainers who prefer a sophisticated and no-fuss appearance. It pairs well with formal outfits like the "Gentlewoman Set" or the "Sporty Set" for a sharp, athletic vibe. Consider darker, natural hair colors like black or dark brown to enhance its refined look, or a vibrant red for a bold statement.
2. **Short Bob:**

   * **Description:** A chic and versatile cut where the hair is typically cut straight around the head, usually around jaw-level. It can be sleek or slightly textured.
   * **Tips:** The Short Bob is incredibly adaptable. It can convey elegance with a side part and sleek styling, or a playful edge with a slight wave. It complements almost any outfit, from casual shorts to more elaborate dresses. Experiment with lighter shades like blonde or ash brown to give it a softer, more approachable feel, or a vibrant blue for an edgy, modern twist.
3. **Short & Wild:**

   * **Description:** This style is all about playful disarray. It features short, choppy layers that give it a spiky, energetic, and slightly rebellious look.
   * **Tips:** Perfect for trainers with an adventurous spirit. This style screams "ready for action" and looks fantastic with more casual, sporty, or even punk-inspired outfits. Bright, unconventional colors like pink, purple, or lime green can truly make this style pop and reflect a vibrant personality.
4. **Bowl Cut:**

   * **Description:** A distinctive, rounded cut where the hair is cut evenly around the head, resembling an inverted bowl. It’s a bold and somewhat retro choice.
   * **Tips:** The Bowl Cut is for trainers who aren’t afraid to stand out. It has a unique, artistic flair and can be surprisingly charming. It works well with quirky or minimalist outfits. To soften its strong lines, consider natural, earthy tones like chestnut or a muted blonde. For a truly avant-garde look, a stark white or silver can be striking.

**Medium & Manageable: Versatility and Charm**

Medium-length hairstyles offer the best of both worlds: enough length for styling without being overly cumbersome. They are incredibly versatile and can suit a wide range of personalities.

5. **Medium Bob:**

   * **Description:** A slightly longer version of the Short Bob, typically reaching the collarbone or just above the shoulders. It can be worn sleek, wavy, or with subtle layers.
   * **Tips:** The Medium Bob is a go-to for its universal appeal. It’s sophisticated enough for formal occasions but casual enough for everyday adventures. It looks particularly elegant with a slight wave. All hair colors work well with this style, but a rich chocolate brown or a warm caramel can enhance its classic beauty.
6. **Pigtails:**

   * **Description:** Two distinct bunches of hair tied on either side of the head, usually higher up. This style exudes youthful innocence and playfulness.
   * **Tips:** Pigtails are perfect for trainers who embrace their cheerful and energetic side. They pair wonderfully with cute, casual, or even school-uniform-inspired outfits. Bright and pastel hair colors like light pink, sky blue, or sunny yellow can amplify the youthful charm of this style.
7. **Braids:**

   * **Description:** This style features two simple, classic braids running down either side of the head, often starting from the temples. It’s a neat, practical, and traditional look.
   * **Tips:** Ideal for trainers who appreciate a wholesome, down-to-earth aesthetic. Braids are practical for outdoor adventures and look great with traditional Alolan wear or more rustic outfits. Natural hair colors like brown, blonde, or even a deep red complement the classic appeal of this style.
8. **Ponytail:**

   * **Description:** A simple, elegant style where all the hair is gathered and tied back at the crown of the head, allowing it to cascade down the back.
   * **Tips:** The Ponytail is the epitome of sporty chic. It’s perfect for trainers on the go, offering a clean and active look. It works seamlessly with athletic wear, but can also be dressed up for a sleek, modern appearance. All hair colors look good, but a vibrant shade like electric blue or fiery orange can add a dynamic edge to this straightforward style.
9. **Side Ponytail:**

   * **Description:** Similar to the regular Ponytail, but the hair is gathered and tied to one side of the head, often draped over the shoulder. It offers a softer, more romantic feel.
   * **Tips:** This style is perfect for trainers who want a touch of casual elegance. It’s less formal than a central ponytail and can add a playful or charming element to an outfit. It looks lovely with sundresses or more relaxed, flowing attire. Soft, natural colors or subtle highlights can enhance its gentle appeal.

**Long & Luxurious: Flowing Locks and Elaborate Styles**

Long hairstyles offer the most dramatic transformations and allow for intricate detailing, perfect for trainers who love to make a grand statement.

10. **Long & Straight:**

    * **Description:** This style features long, straight hair that falls down the back, often with a clean part. It’s sleek, sophisticated, and timeless.
    * **Tips:** The Long & Straight look is a classic for a reason. It conveys elegance and grace. It’s versatile enough for any outfit, from casual to formal. Dark, rich colors like jet black or deep brown enhance its sleekness, while a platinum blonde can give it a striking, high-fashion edge.
11. **Long & Wavy:**

    * **Description:** Characterized by long hair with soft, natural-looking waves that add volume and movement. It’s a relaxed yet effortlessly stylish look.
    * **Tips:** The Long & Wavy style is perfect for trainers who want a romantic, free-spirited, or beachy vibe. It pairs beautifully with flowy dresses, casual wear, and anything that evokes a relaxed Alolan atmosphere. Sun-kissed highlights or warm, earthy tones like golden blonde or auburn can truly bring out the beauty of these waves.
12. **Twin Tails:**

    * **Description:** Unlike the high, youthful pigtails, Twin Tails typically feature longer sections of hair tied lower on either side of the head, often with more volume or styling. It’s a more mature or stylized version of the classic pigtails.
    * **Tips:** This style offers a playful yet chic appeal. It can be cute, edgy, or even sophisticated depending on the outfit. It works well with Japanese-inspired fashion or quirky, modern ensembles. Vibrant colors like electric pink or a deep teal can make this style particularly striking.
13. **Braided Bun:**

    * **Description:** An elegant updo where the hair is gathered into a bun, often incorporating braids for added texture and sophistication.
    * **Tips:** The Braided Bun is the epitome of formal elegance. It’s perfect for special occasions, such as attending a Pokémon Contest or a formal gathering. It complements sophisticated dresses and outfits. Natural, rich hair colors like deep browns, auburns, or classic blondes enhance its refined beauty.
14. **Romantic Tuck:**

    * **Description:** A soft, flowing updo where sections of hair are gently pulled back and tucked, creating a graceful and somewhat ethereal look, often with loose strands framing the face.
    * **Tips:** This style is ideal for trainers who want to exude charm, softness, and a touch of whimsy. It’s perfect for romantic outfits, floral patterns, or anything that speaks to a gentle aesthetic. Lighter hair colors, especially those with subtle highlights, can beautifully accentuate the delicate details of this style.

**The Power of Color: Transforming Your Look**

Beyond the cut, hair color plays a crucial role in defining your character’s style. *Ultra Moon* offers a wide palette, including natural shades like Black, Dark Brown, Ash Brown, Blonde, Ash Blonde, and White, as well as vibrant options like Red, Pink, Orange, Green, Blue, and Purple.

* **Natural Tones:** Enhance classic styles and provide a realistic, grounded look.
* **Vibrant Hues:** Perfect for making a bold statement, expressing a quirky personality, or matching a specific themed outfit. Don’t be afraid to experiment with a shocking pink Short & Wild or a cool blue Long & Straight!

**Tips for Choosing Your Perfect Hairstyle**

1. **Consider Your Outfit:** Your hairstyle should complement your chosen attire. A sleek updo might not match a casual beach outfit, just as wild spikes might clash with a formal gown.
2. **Reflect Your Personality:** Does your character feel adventurous? Try Short & Wild. Is she elegant? Long & Straight or a Braided Bun might be perfect.
3. **Experiment!** The beauty of in-game customization is that it’s not permanent. Don’t be afraid to try out different styles and colors. You can always change it back or try something new.
4. **Match with Accessories:** Hats, glasses, and other accessories can dramatically alter how a hairstyle looks. Some styles might not work with certain hats, so plan accordingly.
5. **Seasonal Vibes (Roleplay):** While not a game mechanic, you can change your hair to suit the "season" or location you’re in. A breezy, wavy style for Akala Island, or a neat bun for the bustling Aether Paradise.

**Conclusion: Your Alolan Fashion Journey Awaits**

The female hairstyles in *Pokémon Ultra Moon* offer a fantastic avenue for self-expression, allowing you to craft a protagonist that truly reflects your personal style. From the sharp lines of a Short Bob to the flowing elegance of Long & Wavy hair, each option provides a unique opportunity to enhance your character’s look. So, head to the nearest hair salon in Alola, experiment with cuts and colors, and embark on your journey not just as a Pokémon Master, but as a true style icon of the region! Your ultimate Alolan look is just a snip and a dye away.
