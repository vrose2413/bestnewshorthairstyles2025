Hello, amazing adventurers! Are you ready to hop into a time machine with me? We’re going to zoom back over one hundred years, all the way to a time called 1914. Imagine that! It was a very different world from the one you live in today. There were no smartphones, no video games, and even no televisions! Cars were just starting to become popular, but many people still rode in horse-drawn carriages. Houses didn’t have electricity like yours, so lights were made with gas or candles. And guess what else was super different? People’s hair! Especially the hair of seven-year-old boys and girls, just like you.

Today, you might see girls with short hair, long hair, curly hair, straight hair, or even hair in all sorts of fun colors! Boys might have spiky hair, buzz cuts, or longer styles. But back in 1914, things were much more particular, especially for girls. Let’s explore what it was like to have hair in 1914!

**Life in 1914: A Peek into the Past**

Before we dive into hairstyles, let’s imagine what a day was like for a seven-year-old in 1914. You would wake up, maybe to the sound of birds or your mom calling you. There wouldn’t be a light switch to flick on; instead, someone might light a gas lamp or open the curtains to let in the sunshine. Your clothes would be different too. Girls often wore long dresses or skirts with blouses, and boys wore knickerbockers (short pants that went just below the knee) with long socks, shirts, and sometimes little jackets.

School was very important, and children often walked there. Playtime might involve simple toys like wooden blocks, dolls, or playing outside with hoops and sticks. Because life was a bit simpler and didn’t have all the speedy machines we have today, people had different ideas about what looked nice and what was practical. And that really affected how they did their hair!

**Girls’ Hair: The Golden Rule – Long and Lovely!**

If you were a seven-year-old girl in 1914, there was one very important rule about your hair: it was almost always long! Most girls, from tiny toddlers to teenagers, had long hair. Why? Well, it was considered very beautiful and proper for girls to have long, flowing hair. Haircuts were not as common as they are today, and many parents believed that long hair was a sign of a well-cared-for child.

Imagine having hair that reached your waist, or even longer! Think about how much brushing that would take every morning and every night. It wasn’t just about looking pretty; long hair also needed to be kept neat and tidy, especially for school or going out. This is where some very clever and popular hairstyles came in handy.

**The Amazing World of Braids: Neat, Tidy, and Pretty!**

The most popular way for girls to wear their long hair in 1914 was in braids. Braids were like the superheroes of hairstyles! They kept all that long hair neat, out of the way, and looking lovely. Plus, they were practical for playing, running, and learning. Let’s look at some of the super popular braid styles:

1. **The Classic Pigtails:** This was probably the most common and easiest style. Imagine dividing your long hair into two sections, one on each side of your head. Then, each section would be braided all the way down to the end. These two braids would hang down, one over each shoulder, or sometimes down the back. Pigtails were perfect for everyday play, going to school, and just being a busy seven-year-old. They kept hair from getting tangled in books or while you were running around.
2. **Fancy French Braids:** Sometimes, for a slightly fancier look, girls would wear French braids. Have you ever seen a French braid? Instead of starting the braid at the back of the head, a French braid starts right at the top of the head, near the forehead. As you braid, you keep adding small sections of hair from the sides, making the braid lie flat against the head. For a seven-year-old, this might mean one big French braid going down the back, or sometimes two French braids, one on each side, just like fancy pigtails! French braids looked very neat and stayed in place really well, even if you were skipping or jumping. They made a girl look very well-groomed and ready for anything.
3. **Coronet Braids (or Crown Braids):** For very special occasions, like a birthday party, a family gathering, or perhaps a Sunday church service, a girl might wear a coronet braid. This is a super elegant style where the long braid (or sometimes two braids) is wrapped around the head, like a beautiful crown! It looked very grown-up and graceful. Imagine having your long, beautiful braid carefully pinned around your head, making you feel like a princess. This style took a bit more time and help from a parent, but it was worth it for those special days.

Why were braids so popular? Well, besides looking nice, they were incredibly practical. Long hair, if left loose, could get messy quickly. It could get in your eyes, get tangled, or even get caught on things while you were playing. Braids kept everything tidy and out of the way, allowing girls to run, play, and learn without their hair bothering them. They were also a great way to protect the hair from getting too dirty or damaged, as it was all neatly tucked away.

**Ribbons, Ribbons Everywhere! The Ultimate Accessory**

Now, imagine you have your beautiful long braids. What’s missing? Ribbons! Ribbons were the most important hair accessory for girls in 1914. They weren’t just for decoration; they were part of the whole look.

Ribbons came in all sorts of colors. Girls might wear ribbons that matched their dresses, or simply choose their favorite color. Red, blue, pink, white, and even striped ribbons were popular. They were often made of pretty materials like silk, satin, or velvet.

How were they used?

* **Tied at the end of braids:** This was the most common way. After a braid was finished, a pretty ribbon would be tied around the end, often in a neat bow. This not only looked lovely but also helped to keep the braid from unraveling.
* **Woven into braids:** Sometimes, for a really special touch, a thin ribbon might be woven right into the braid itself, making the braid look even more colorful and intricate.
* **As headbands:** While not as common as tying them into braids, sometimes a ribbon might be tied around the head like a simple headband, especially if a girl had shorter bangs (which were called a fringe back then).

Ribbons added a touch of charm and personality to every hairstyle. They showed that a girl’s hair was not only neat but also cared for and made to look pretty. It was a simple way to add a bit of flair to an everyday look.

**Other Styles and Details for Girls**

While braids and ribbons were kings and queens of 1914 hairstyles for girls, there were a few other things to know:

* **Curls:** Sometimes, girls would have soft curls. But remember, there were no curling irons that heated up with electricity! So, how did they get curls? Often, it was done by using "rag curls." Before bed, small sections of damp hair would be wrapped around strips of cloth (rags) and tied tightly. When the rags were unwrapped in the morning, the hair would have soft, bouncy curls! This was a fun way to have a different look for a day.
* **Bangs (Fringes):** Some girls did have bangs, or what they called a "fringe." These were usually cut straight across the forehead, just above the eyebrows. They added a sweet look to the face, even with long hair and braids.
* **Hairpins:** Simple hairpins, usually made of metal, were used to help hold braids in place, especially those fancy coronet braids, or to tuck away any stray wisps of hair.

**Boys’ Hair in 1914: Neat and Tidy**

Now, what about the boys? If you were a seven-year-old boy in 1914, your hair would have been much simpler than the girls’. Boys usually had shorter hair, cut neatly around their ears and the back of their neck. It was often parted on the side, creating a very clean and tidy look. Sometimes, a little bit of hair cream or water would be used to keep the hair smooth and in place.

Boys’ hairstyles were all about looking respectable and neat. There weren’t many fancy styles for boys; the focus was on being well-groomed. And just like today, boys often wore hats or caps when they were outside, which would cover their hair anyway!

**Hair Care in 1914: A Different Kind of Wash Day!**

Imagine washing your hair without all the fancy shampoos and conditioners we have today! In 1914, hair washing was a much simpler, and perhaps less frequent, affair.

* **Washing:** People used simple soap and water to wash their hair. There weren’t many different kinds of shampoos for different hair types. Hair was often washed in a basin or a tub, not usually under a shower like we do now.
* **Drying:** And guess what? No blow dryers! After washing, hair would be carefully towel-dried and then left to air dry. For girls with very long hair, this could take a long, long time! Imagine sitting patiently while your hair slowly dried.
* **Brushing:** Brushing was super important. With long hair, regular brushing helped to keep it free of tangles and spread the natural oils from the scalp down to the ends, making the hair look shiny and healthy. Girls would spend a lot of time each day carefully brushing their long locks.

It took a lot of time and effort to keep hair looking nice in 1914, especially for girls. It wasn’t just a quick wash and go; it was a daily ritual of brushing, braiding, and adding pretty ribbons.

**Comparing Then and Now: How Hair Has Changed!**

Isn’t it amazing to think about how different things were just over a hundred years ago? Today, you have so many choices for your hair! Girls can have super short bobs, long flowing hair, wild curls, or sleek straight hair. You can use fun hair clips, headbands, or colorful ties. Boys have many more styles too, from spiky to shaggy.

The world has changed so much, and so have our ideas about what looks good and what is practical. In 1914, long hair and braids for girls were a sign of beauty and properness. Today, we celebrate all kinds of hair and all kinds of styles!

Learning about 1914 hairstyles for seven-year-olds helps us understand that even small things, like how we wear our hair, can tell us a big story about how people lived, what they valued, and how different the world was a long, long time ago. So, the next time you brush your hair or put on a hair tie, take a moment to imagine what it would have been like to live in 1914 with long, beautiful braids and pretty ribbons! It’s a fun way to connect with the past.
