The 1970s, often remembered as the "Me Decade," was a transformative era that saw significant shifts in fashion, music, and social norms. For tween girls navigating the cusp of childhood and adolescence, this decade offered an exciting departure from the more structured styles of previous generations. Hair became a powerful tool for self-expression, reflecting a broader cultural embrace of naturalism, individuality, and a relaxed, effortless aesthetic. Tween girls 1970s hairstyles were characterized by their versatility, ease of maintenance, and an underlying sense of playful liberation, moving away from rigid formality towards looks that celebrated natural texture and movement.

Unlike the perfectly coiffed bouffants of the 1960s or the highly stylized waves of earlier decades, 1970s hair for young girls leaned into a more organic, less-is-more philosophy. The emphasis was on healthy, flowing locks that could be easily styled at home, often with minimal heat or chemical treatments. This accessibility meant that a wide range of looks became popular, allowing tweens to experiment and find styles that suited their burgeoning personalities.

**The Long & Straight Dominion: A Canvas of Simplicity**

Perhaps the most iconic and pervasive tween girls 1970s hairstyle, particularly in the early part of the decade, was long, straight hair. This look was a direct descendant of the late 1960s hippie movement, symbolizing a rejection of artificiality and an embrace of natural beauty. For tween girls, long, straight hair was both aspirational and practical. It was easy to achieve, required minimal fuss, and served as a versatile canvas for various accessories.

Achieving the coveted straight look often involved a simple blow-dry with a paddle brush, pulling the hair taut to eliminate waves or curls. For those with more stubborn natural texture, more unconventional methods sometimes emerged, such as the infamous "ironing" technique, where a clothes iron (on a low setting, thankfully) was used to press sections of hair flat. While certainly not recommended today due to the extreme heat damage, it speaks to the lengths some went to achieve the desired sleekness.

The beauty of long, straight hair for tweens lay in its effortless charm. It allowed for freedom of movement during play and school activities, and its simplicity made it universally appealing. Accessories were key to personalizing this look. Wide fabric headbands, often in floral prints or solid colors, were incredibly popular, keeping hair out of the face while adding a touch of bohemian chic. Ribbons, tied into bows or simply woven through the hair, also provided a sweet and innocent embellishment. Barrettes, both simple snap clips and more decorative ones, were used to pull back sections of hair, creating half-up styles or securing bangs.

**The Shag: Layers of Liberation**

As the decade progressed, a more layered and textured look began to gain traction, eventually evolving into the ubiquitous "shag." While often associated with rock stars and more mature styles, softer, more manageable versions of the shag found their way into tween girls 1970s hairstyles. The shag was characterized by its choppy, uneven layers, typically shorter at the crown and gradually lengthening towards the ends. This created volume and movement, giving the hair a slightly disheheveled, yet effortlessly cool, appearance.

For tweens, the shag offered a liberating alternative to perfectly straight hair. It required even less styling effort, often looking best with a simple wash-and-go approach. The layers added bounce and body, making fine hair appear fuller and taming thicker hair into a more manageable shape. Bangs were an integral part of the shag, often cut in a wispy, feathered, or blunt style that blended seamlessly into the layers around the face. This cut was perfect for active girls who wanted a stylish look that wouldn’t get in the way of their daily adventures. It embodied the era’s relaxed vibe, allowing for individuality without demanding constant upkeep.

**The Feathered Phenomenon: Farrah’s Flight**

By the mid-to-late 1970s, one hairstyle reigned supreme, becoming arguably the most iconic look of the entire decade: the feathered hairstyle, famously popularized by Farrah Fawcett of "Charlie’s Angels." While Farrah’s signature style was voluminous and dramatic, tween girls adopted softer, more approachable versions of the feathered look, adapting it to their age and hair type.

The feathered look involved layers that were expertly cut and styled to curve away from the face, creating a "winged" effect. For tweens, this often meant less extreme layering and a focus on the front sections of hair. To achieve the look, girls would typically use a blow dryer with a round brush, curling sections of hair outwards from the face. Large rollers, particularly hot rollers, were also a popular tool for creating the necessary volume and outward curl. The result was a bouncy, glamorous, yet still natural-looking style that exuded confidence and a touch of Hollywood allure.

For tween girls, the feathered style was a symbol of growing up, of embracing a more sophisticated, yet still youthful, aesthetic. It was a step beyond the simple straight hair, offering more shape and movement while still maintaining an air of effortlessness. The feathered look perfectly encapsulated the late 70s blend of natural beauty with a hint of polished glamour, making it a highly coveted style among young girls eager to emulate their pop culture idols.

**Braids, Pigtails, and Ponytails: Timeless Staples**

Beyond the trend-driven styles, certain classic looks remained enduringly popular for tween girls throughout the 1970s due to their practicality and timeless appeal. Braids, pigtails, and ponytails were the workhorses of tween girls 1970s hairstyles, perfect for school, sports, and everyday play.

**Pigtails**, whether high on the head or low at the nape of the neck, were a quintessential symbol of youthful innocence. They were easy to create and kept hair neatly out of the way, making them ideal for active girls. Ribbons, often in colors matching an outfit, were frequently tied around the elastic bands, adding a touch of charm.

**Braids** offered more variety and a slightly more polished look. Simple three-strand braids were common, either as single braids down the back or as two braids framing the face. French braids, which incorporated sections of hair from the scalp as they progressed, were also popular, offering a more intricate and secure style that was perfect for longer hair. While not as widespread for all tweens, the 1970s also saw the growing visibility of **cornrows**, particularly within Black communities, as a beautiful and practical protective style that showcased intricate artistry.

The **ponytail** was, and remains, a universal go-to. In the 1970s, ponytails for tweens were often worn high on the crown for a sporty look, or lower at the nape for a more relaxed feel. Side ponytails also made an appearance, adding a playful asymmetry. Like pigtails, ponytails were often adorned with simple elastic bands, sometimes covered with fabric or embellished with ribbons. The versatility of the ponytail meant it could be adapted for any occasion, from a casual day at the park to a slightly more dressed-up event.

**The Bangs & Fringe Factor**

Regardless of the primary hairstyle, bangs (or fringe, as they are known in British English) were an almost ubiquitous feature of tween girls 1970s hairstyles. They framed the face, softened features, and added a youthful touch to any cut. Bangs in the 70s varied from blunt, straight cuts that hovered just above the eyebrows to wispy, feathered fringes that blended seamlessly into the layers of a shag or feathered style. They could be worn straight across, parted in the middle, or swept to the side, offering yet another avenue for personal expression within a broader trend.

**Accessories: The Finishing Touches**

Accessories in the 1970s for tween girls were generally understated, complementing the natural aesthetic rather than overpowering it. Headbands, as mentioned, were incredibly popular – from wide fabric bands that covered a significant portion of the forehead to thinner elastic bands that simply held hair back. Knotted headbands, often made from bandanas or patterned fabric, also added a casual, bohemian vibe.

Barrettes and snap clips were practical for holding back sections of hair, especially bangs or side pieces. While less ornate than those from previous decades, they often featured simple designs, sometimes with a touch of glitter or a subtle floral motif. Ribbons remained a timeless choice, used to tie off braids, ponytails, or simply woven into loose hair. Scarves, folded into headbands or tied around ponytails, also offered a touch of bohemian flair, reflecting the era’s free-spirited mood. The emphasis was on simplicity and functionality, allowing the natural beauty of the hair to shine through.

**Hair Care & Culture: A Natural Approach**

The approach to hair care for tween girls in the 1970s mirrored the decade’s broader emphasis on naturalism. Products were generally simpler, with less focus on heavy styling mousses or gels (which would become more prevalent in the 80s). Shampoos and conditioners were designed to keep hair clean and healthy, promoting its natural texture. The DIY spirit was strong; girls often styled their own hair, learning simple techniques from friends, magazines, or by observing older siblings and pop culture icons.

Television shows like "The Brady Bunch" offered a glimpse into everyday family life, showcasing the popular hairstyles of the time on characters like Marcia and Jan. Music icons and teen magazines also played a significant role in disseminating trends, inspiring young girls to experiment with new looks. The 1970s was a time when beauty standards became less rigid, allowing for more individual interpretation and a greater acceptance of diverse hair textures. This freedom was particularly beneficial for tweens, who were encouraged to embrace their natural selves while still having fun with their appearance.

**Conclusion**

Tween girls 1970s hairstyles were a delightful blend of natural ease, playful experimentation, and emerging sophistication. From the simple elegance of long, straight locks to the dynamic layers of the shag and the aspirational glamour of the feathered look, the decade offered a diverse palette for young girls to express themselves. Practical staples like braids, pigtails, and ponytails remained ever-present, while understated accessories added personal touches. Reflecting the broader cultural shifts of the "Me Decade," 1970s hair for tweens celebrated individuality, freedom, and an effortless charm that continues to inspire and captivate. It was a time when hair was less about strict adherence to rules and more about embracing one’s natural beauty with a dash of contemporary flair.
